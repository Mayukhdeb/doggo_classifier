# doggo_classifier
NN classifies dogs based on breed.
### Current Status
This time i have implemented using rgb images for training data instead of converting them to gray-scale.
The maximum accuracy of predicting a dog from the data-set is <85%.
The reason is that the background is interfering so to eliminate this noise ill have to crop out the image based on the dog's outline which is difficult to trace using ml.
